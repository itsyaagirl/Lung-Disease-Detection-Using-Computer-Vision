1. Covid Xray- 
https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset

(Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), Radiopaedia etc.) of COVID-19 cases for research purpose and most of the studies on COVID-19 use images from this source. The repository contains an open database of COVID-19 cases with chest X-ray or CT images and is being updated regularly)

2. Pneumonia(bacterial and viral)  - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

Pneumonia bacterial, Pneumonia viral and normal chest X-ray images were obtained from Kaggle repository “Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)”. The dataset consists of 1203 normal, 660 bacterial Pneumonia and 931 viral Pneumonia cases. We collected a total of 1300 images from these two sources
